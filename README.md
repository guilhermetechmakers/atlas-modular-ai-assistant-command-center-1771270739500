# Atlas — Modular AI Assistant & Command Center

This project was created with ScopesFlow automation.

## Development

1. **Install dependencies** (required before build or dev):
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
   If you use `NODE_ENV=production`, install with dev dependencies so Vite and TypeScript are available:
   ```bash
   npm install --include=dev
   ```

2. **Run the dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Build for production:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
